# 🏰 Tower Defense Game in Java

Welcome to my **Tower Defense Game**, built entirely in Java!  
This is my first ever attempt at making a game.

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a classic **tower defense game** where players must defend their base by strategically placing towers to stop waves of enemies.

I followed the tutorials and built the core logic from scratch, adapting and learning along the way. The goal was not just to follow instructions, but to **understand Java game development** fundamentals — from rendering graphics to managing game states and user input.
